# RESTify Analyzer

Automated reliable testing of RESTify experiment submissions.

## About

This software is a tool written specifically for analysis of the data acquired throughout the RESTify experiment.

 * The RESTify experiment produced 28 participant submissions with two restful services each.  
 * A manual inspection is overly time intense and errorprone.
 * This repository [hosts a bash script](analyze.sh) that automatically test all submissions and generate test reports in a reliable manner.

## Procedure

### Main Double Iterations

* The script preforms a double loop over all participant folders. Both iterations run all tests, however they differ regarding write-operations (operations that alter state of the tested submission).
  * The first iteration verifies the effects of every encountered write operations. A test is only labeled as successful if the write operation succeeds and the subsecquent read operation confirms its effectiveness.
  * The second iteration only assesses write operations. A write operation is considered successful, if their execution does not return an error.
* Tests are only assumed successful, if either of the following is true:
  * Both iterations resulted in a positive test assessment. (*Write* and *Read* succeeded)
  * The first iteration failed, the second succeeded and there is an error identified in the associated read operation. (*Write* succeeded, *Read* failed, but the error is in the implementation of the *Read* operation. The original *Write* operation is hence assumed successful.)

 > Note: The scenario of a successful *Write*, and unsuccessful *Read* validation is very rare. It is recommended to investigate these cases manually, to exclude possibility of a false-positive *Write*.

### True State Reset

 * The tests verify state status and changes of the tested service.
 * Failing tests can blemish the outcome of subsequent tests.
 * We therefore perform a complete state reset of the tested service, after every interaction.
 * This is done by a complete service restart.  
Service restarts are time-consuming, but the safest way to ensure a clean service state.

## Usage

 * Get hold of the original study source code submissions: ```submission.zip```  
(Source code of the two RESTful services produced by every RESTify study participant).  
 > Note: For participant anonymity compliance reasons the participant source code submissions cannot be published here. [Contact the authors](#authors) if you need to reproduce the unit tests results.
 * Unzip the ```submissions.zip```, make sure the ```UPLOADDIR``` variable correctly references the submissions source codes.
 * Clone the sources the two REST application test scenarios.  
Update the corresponding ```XOXTESTDIR``` and ```BSTESTDIR``` variables to match the location.
    * [BookStore REST Tests](https://github.com/m5c/BookStoreRestTest) on GitHub
    * [Xox REST Tests](https://github.com/m5c/XoxStudyRestTest) on GitHub
 * Call: ```./analyze.sh```, wait for script to finish. (May take several hours)  
Command line options:
   * ```-h```: Print help message with further usage information
   * ```-d```: Run in debug mode (print all intermediate results)
   * ```v```: Enable read verfication for write operations.  only considered as successful, if the state change if the initial write operation is reflected in the read result. By default this option is disabled.
 This option is by default disabled.
   *  ```-u Colour-Animal```:  Reduce test scope to a single study submission. Name of the target participant code name must be provided, e.g. Pink-Snail
 * Inspect the test reports
   * CSV file for further scripted visualizations: *report-folder*/tests.csv  
This file is consumed as input data by the [RestifyJupyter](https://github.com/m5c/RestifyJupyter) project.
   * Human-readable markdown report: *report-folder*/report.md
 This file also contains hotlinks to relevant code snippets, in case a subsequent manual inspection is required.

## Development

Use IntelliJ IDEA, make sure to enable the [Shell Script](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13122-shell-script) plugin.  
This provides automatic execution of the [Shell Check](https://www.shellcheck.net/) static code linter and enforces a minimum of code style and readability.
